# Cohort Anomalies

## Project Description

Identify anomalies and metrics in student access to the Codeup Curriculum

## Project Goal

Identify:

* most and least popular lessons
* less active students
* suspicious activity
* frequently referenced topics

## Initial Thoughts

The program with the most cohorts will have the most diverse log activity.

## The Plan

* Acquire data from Codeup MySQL DB
* Prepare data:
  * Look at the data:
    * nulls
    * value counts
    * distribution of values
    * data types
    * numerical/categorical columns
    * names of columns
* Explore/Analyze data:
  * Answer the following questions:
    1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
    2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
    3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
    4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
    5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?
    6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
    7. Which lessons are least accessed?
    8. Are there any other anomalies?
* Conclusions:
  * Identify anomalies and analyze Codeup metrics

## Data Dictionary

| Feature          | Definition (measurement)                                   |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| datetime (index) | date and time of user access to the Codeup Curriculum      |
| path             | The path to the curriculum                                 |
| user_id          | ID for the user accessing the curriculum                   |
| cohort_id        | Quality rating given by users out of max score of 5        |
| ip               | IP address at the time of access                           |
| name             | Name of the Cohort                                         |
| start_date       | Start date of the Cohort                                   |
| end_date         | End date of the Cohort                                     |
| program_id       | ID of the Codeup program (i.e. WebDev, Data Science, etc.) |

## Steps to Reproduce

1) Clone this repo
2) If you have access to the Codeup MySQL DB:
   * Save **env.py** in the repo w/ `user`, `password`, and `host` variables
   * Run notebook
3) If you don't have access:
   * Request access from Codeup
   * Do step 2
